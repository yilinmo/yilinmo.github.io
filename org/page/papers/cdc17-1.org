** Abstract
In this paper, we consider the problem of sequential detection with $m$ sensors in adversarial environment. An attacker intends to increase the detection error by modifying $n$ out of $m$ sensorsâ€™ measurements. On the other hand, the detector needs to be designed to achieve the optimal performance during the attack. The problem is formulated as a game between detector and adversary in this paper. We study both cases where $m > 2n$ and $m \leq 2n$, and obtain an equilibrium strategy pair of detection rule and attack scheme for both cases. Furthermore, we investigate the efficiency of our proposed detection strategy in the absence of attacker.
